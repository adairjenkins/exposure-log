## Description

This application is designed to track exposures used in Exposure Therapy. Exposure therapy is a technique used for treating a range of disorders including generalized anxiety, social anxiety, PTSD, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. It uses systematic confrontation of feared stimuli within safe settings to retrain the brain and help the individual dehabitualize their fear response to the targeted stimuli.

An exposure hierarchy is a tool that guides how an individual progresses through exposures. The hierarchy is a list of situations generated by the individual and specific to their experiences that trigger the targeted fear response. Each situation receives a ranking between 1 and 10 and should be a scenario the individual can repeat. The goal is also to include situations that cause a range of distress levels. The individual begins with the lowest ranking scenario and repeatedly exposes themselves to the situation while also tracking their pre, peak, and post level of distress. Tracking distress levels provides feedback about the individual’s habituation to the situation, as well as indicates when it’s appropriate to move up to the next scenario in the hierarchy.

This app provides a means for recording and charting progression through an exposure hierarchy. The user is able to build a hierarchy based on their target fear, record distress levels during each exposure, and view a history of all completed exposures. Additional features include setting daily and weekly goals, as well as a graph that displays progress and habituation over time to each situation.

Exposures are inherently unpleasant and require willingness and determination to repeatedly expose oneself to distressing experiences. The goal of this app is to both track the user’s progress as well as give the user a sense of accomplishment and self-efficacy as they work their way through an exposure hierarchy.

## Getting Started

Getting started ....

### Prerequisites

Prerequisites go here

### Installation

Create a database named "exposure-log". Necessary queries for building the database and sample data are in the database.sql file.

Using editor of choice, from the terminal run npm install, followed by npm run server and npm run client. Project will load at url localhost:3000.

## Usage

This app relies on user generated data. To see a demo based on exposures for a fear of dogs, add sample data to database using queries from database.sql file. A demo account is also available in the deployed version using Demo Account login.
